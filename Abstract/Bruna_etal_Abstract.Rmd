abstract: |
  \par Habitat fragmentation remains a major focus of research by ecologists decades after being put forward as a threat to the integrity of ecosystems. Decades of research have documented myriad biotic changes in gragmented landscapes, including the local extinction of species from fragments. The demographic mechanisms underlying these extinctions are rarely known. However, many of them – especially in lowland tropical forests – are thought to be driven by one of two mechanisms: (1) reduced recruitment in fragments resulting from changes in the diversity or abundance of pollinators and seed dispersers or (2) increased rates of individual mortality in fragmentds due to dramatically altered abiotic conditions. Unfortunately, tests of these potential mechanisms remain limited due to the paucity of long-term demographic data collected in both forest fragments and continuous forest sites. 
    \par _Heliconia acuminata_ (LC Rich.) is an understory herb that is widely distributed throughout the Amazon basin. found at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project. Here we report 12 years (1997-2009) of demographic data from _H. acuminata_ populations at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project, located north of Manaus, Brazil. The thirteen populations were located in permanent plots established in each of seven experimentally isolated fragments (four 1-ha fragments and three 10-ha fragments) and in six continuous forest sites; each plot was $50\times100$m and the distance between plots ranged from 500 m-60 km. The plants in each plot were censused annually, at which time we recorded, identified, marked, and measured new seedlings, identified any previously marked plants that died, and recorded the size of suriving individuals. Plots were also surveyed during the flowering season to identify reproductive plants and record the number of inflorescences each produced. The dataset comprises >67,000 plant$\times$year records of >8500 plants, including >3400 seedlings established after the first census. To date these data have been used to investigate topics ranging from how fragmentation-related reductions in germination influence population dynamics to statistical methods for analyzing reproductive rates.  
    \par There are no restrictions on the use this data set, but we do ask that those using the data for teaching or research inform us of how they are doing so and cite this paper and the data archive if appropriate. Any publication using the data must also include a BDFFP Technical Series Number in the Acknowledgments. Authors can request this series number upon the acceptance of their article by contacting the BDFFP's Scientific Coordinator or E. M. Bruna.
