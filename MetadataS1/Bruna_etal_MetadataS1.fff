Plots are located in Continuous Forest (CF1-CF6) or Forest Fragments (FF1-FF7), both of which are dark green. Light green areas are regenerating forest, while red indicates pasture. The BDFFP is located ~70 km north of Manaus, Brazil (inset map). For additional details on each plot see Table 1.}\label{fig:map}
