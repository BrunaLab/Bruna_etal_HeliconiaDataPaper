## _Heliconia_ Data Paper Manuscript

This is the repository for *Demography of the understory herb _Heliconia acuminata_ (Heliconiaceae) in an experimentally fragmented tropical landscape* by Bruna _et al._ The manuscript describes the collection, cleaning, and organizing of the data found in [https://github.com/BrunaLab/HeliconiaSurveys](https://github.com/BrunaLab/HeliconiaSurveys). 

Each section of the submission is in its own folder: 

`/Abstract` and `/MetadataS1`

Inside of each is an. .Rmd file, which when rendered will provide versions of the file in `.pdf` and `.docx` format. Note that the `docx` version is not in the format required for submission.
